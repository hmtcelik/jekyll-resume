# Personal Website

My personal website built with Jekyll. Jekyll is static website generator so you can create a static website very easily. If you want to use this website, firstly you have to install jekyll on your computer

## Installation
Jekyll is a Ruby gem. First, install Ruby on your machine.

**Windows** : https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/ <br>
**macOS**: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/  <br>
**Ubuntu**: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/ <br>
**Other Linux**: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/other-linux/ <br>

So after these steps, Ruby installed, now install Jekyll from the terminal: 

```
gem install jekyll bundler
``` 
And after go project root directory and run
```
bundle init
```
(output: gemfile already installed)

Now you ready to run website on your localhost:
```
